This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

Run dev spins up a node server and the development server of our react app.

### `npm run test`

Runs our admittedly limited test suite.

## Notes

I had a self-imposed timelimit of two hours on this test, I ended up going to about two and a half hours mainly due to my unfamiliarity with react testing library and messing around with a debounce hook.

I'm not sure if it was my internet, or if avataaars.io was having difficulties, however, it was occassionally silently failing the loading of avatars.

As there was no CSS mentioned, I hope you can forgive my lack of styling.

Thank you for your time and I appreciated your time conscious assignment.
